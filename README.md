# ITESO_SmartParking

A smart IoT-based parking solution designed to assist ITESO students in finding parking spots efficiently.

## Project Overview

ITESO students, when arriving at their classes at the university, often face challenges in finding a parking space, especially during peak times. Our solution, powered by IoT devices and a user-friendly app, aims to reduce the time and stress involved in this process.

## Features

- **Real-time Data**: Using IoT sensors, we gather real-time data about the availability of parking spots.
- **User-friendly App**: An intuitive application that displays available parking spots to users.
- **API Integration**: Seamless connectivity between the hardware and software components via an API.

## Repository Structure

- [`hardware/`](./hardware/): Information related to hardware components.
- [`api/`](./api/): The backend API for the project.
- [`ui/`](./ui/): All user interface-related files.
- [`mqtt/`](./mqtt/): MQTT configuration and implementation details.
- [`demo/`](./demo/): Materials related to project demonstrations.

## Setup

1. **API**: Navigate to the `api` directory and follow the setup instructions in its README.
2. **UI**: Navigate to the `ui` directory for setup and usage details.
